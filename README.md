# HHS Source Code Anti-Data Call

Tracking source code repositories, codespaces, and resources funded by HHS offices. 

## About This Project

The HHS Immediate Office of the Secretary (IOS), HHS Chief Data Officer (CDO), and HHS CMS Open Source Program Office (OSPO) have an "anti-goal" to eliminate HHS data calls 
to reduce reporting burden on program offices. To move HHS towards this goal, this "Anti-Data Call" is a GitHub pilot to eliminate Excel trackers and version control 
challenges with data calls.
